  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements with good coverage. REQ-1 (backend), REQ-2 (hook), REQ-3 (component), and REQ-4 (navigation/view) are all addressed. However, REQ-1's backend implementation in main.mo is truncated and cannot be fully verified. REQ-4 specifies showing both diet AND workout plan results after submission, but the implementation shows them in separate tabs. Minor concerns exist but most ACs are satisfied.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "After a user selects their fitness goal and submits, show both the diet plan results and the workout plan results.",
      "reason": "The implementation places diet and workout plans in separate tabs (AI Diet Planner and Workout Planner) rather than showing both results together after a single submission. The WorkoutPlannerView only shows workout plan results, not both diet and workout results simultaneously.",
