Backend functions for setting and retrieving daily calorie goals were added in backend/main.mo with proper authentication and per-user storage. Frontend includes a GoalSettingForm component with validation and error handling. The CaloriesSummary component displays the current goal and a progress bar toward the goal. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
